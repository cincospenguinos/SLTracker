TODO:
* Make the text flip between "Wait X seconds" and "Set X of Y"
* Implement going back to a set during a workout
* Chalk stuff still needs to be centered properly. Like do the math. ---> Pebble Round
* Make the timer bar move backward if ninety seconds have elapsed

BUGS:
* Rapidly moving through sets causes weird timer issues. ---> Check the timer library that you made
* Changing exercises causes rep count to disappear
