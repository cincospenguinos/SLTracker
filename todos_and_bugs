TODO:
* Chalk stuff still needs to be centered properly. Like do the math. ---> Pebble Round
* Make the timer bar move backward if ninety seconds have elapsed

BUGS:
* Rapidly moving through sets causes weird timer issues. ---> Check the timer library that you made
* Drawing on top off the timer bar has weird behavior in timer_bar_draw_proc
